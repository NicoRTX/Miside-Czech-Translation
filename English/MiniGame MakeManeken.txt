Wait, what am I doing over here?
I need to get to your screen...
Hold on...
So!
You need to make sure that it's a suitable prototype.
Scan the prototype first.
Now, let's compare the version and bone quantity.
Take this prototype's data film and compare it to the standard.
It's a perfect match! Now, let's check its emotions.
The specimen displays the correct emotions! Time to test its behavior.
Okay, we've checked everything, and it's all good! Now pull the lever up.
Yay! Now her skin is on! Pass her the box of clothes.
That's it! See those lights on top? One of them turned green, which means we did it right!
I'll leave the rest to you. I'll be back when all the lights turn green. Good luck!
