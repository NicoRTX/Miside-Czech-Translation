I... I'm back!?

Oh, my God!
You scared me!
Oh, man,
My save—oh, no!
I don't get it...
Where did the game go?
You've ruined the entire route!
What do you want?

I need the version...

Huh?

I have to get back to the old version somehow.

Ah... Listen up!
I'm way too busy
to entertain fools like yourself!

Busy with what? Games?

Look at him, what a jerk!
The friendship between us was not to be...

Listen, I need to get to the Core.

Ow ow ow... It's your fault I got hurt.
Damn.
Wait... Huh?

...I need to get to the Core and stop Mita!

Mita?
Do what you please!
I don't care about her!
Not the first, not the hundredth!

But you're Mita, too...

I'm Mila.

Mi-Ta? La?

It's Mita this, Mita that,
Mita here, Mita there, Mita everywhere!

So... you're Mila?

Yes, I told you! How slow can you be?

Well, good luck then, Mila...

Where are you going?
Think you can just walk out of here like that?

// Player check exit
Did you think you'd find something in there?

Oh, hell nah!
What is this?

What were you expecting—
Wonderland?

Then, where's the way out?
There's supposed to be a passage here.

There's no way out.

Well, which version is this, then?
I should be on the right track.

// Glitch kitchen
Is this yours?

Stay back!
I don't know what that is...
It's a glitch of some kind!

My ring is vibrating for some reason.

What kind of ring?
An engagement ring?

No, it was given to me by one of the Mitas—one of the thousands of them.
The one that might be able to get me out.

And you're going to touch that thing?
You should know, I'm going to kill you if my house blows up!

// Bathroom - Mila is washing
Hey!
Get OUT!
Can't you see the bathroom's occupied?!
// The player continues to stand 1
Why are you still standing there?!
Get out of here!
// The player continues to stand 2
Don't piss me off!
Get OUT already!
// The player continues to stand 3
Are you deaf or what?!
I'm taking a shower!

// Mila came out and swears
What was that?
You have no shame...

Ugh!
Why did you suddenly decide to take a shower?
You could've waited until I was gone!

I didn't know how long you'd be here.
How much longer are you gonna keep messing with these glitches, anyway?

Glitches?
There are more?

Yeah...
well, if my house is still standing,
I guess you've handled the glitch in the kitchen?

Kinda did.

Good. Now, you have my permission
to go into the bathroom.

Thank you.

// Mila hides under the table
Mila?
What are you doing under there?

Ouch!
You scared me again!
What do you want?

Have you seen any more glitches?

Oh, so your problems are supposed to
be an excuse to stop me from finishing my book?
No, I haven't!

All right, I'll go look by myself.

Ah... Hold on,
I want to ask you...
you're doing all this to escape this place,
aren't you?

That's right.
I want to get out of this game.

This might sound strange...
but won't you stay here and read with me?

First you yell at me,
 and now you ask me to stay and read books?
Perhaps I would have stayed,
but I have to keep moving.

Ugh... fine!
Go on and look for your glitches...
That's the second time I've hurt myself
because of you!
// Player saw a glitch
Ah, found it.

// Mila stands with a sword
Are you paying attention?
Fear me!
Look what I can do!
That's how dangerous I am!
You didn't even have time to blink.

Seriously?!

What's wrong?
Was that not convincing enough?

That's not it...

So, you've seen everything 
while solving those glitches, have you?
You already knew
the stone was pre-cut?

No.
It's just... we're in a game.
Here, you can do anything with a snap of your fingers.

You!
You idiot!
A snap of my fingers, huh?
What do you think I've been reading all those books for?
So I could snap my fingers and be done with it?
I'd rather do everything with my own two hands,
exactly the way the books describe it.

// Mila is doing push-ups
What are you doing?

Can't you tell!?

Yeah, but why are you doing them?

To punch you right in the face!

What's wrong with you?
You're acting weird.

Okay!
About the punching thing—
I wasn't serious.
And I'm not weird!
I'm unique!
I want to be as different from everyone else as possible.

You don't have to try so hard.
Trust me—you're already plenty different.

I know!
Look what I can do!
See that?
And now—no hands!

I know this is a game,
but this is ridiculously unrealistic...

Ouch!
Ohh!
Stupid laws of physics...
as soon as you remember about them
BOOM!
This happens!
Why did you have to remind me?
Dummy!

// Last glitch ready - player exit
There's the passage.
We did it, Mila!


Wow!
You're a hero!

Ouch!

Oh!
Sorry—I didn't mean to.

It's fine, Mila. I can move on now.

Look, I know you need to go...
but can't you stay here
just a little longer?

I can't wait.
Crazy Mita isn't exactly the patient type.

I hate her...

I hate her, I hate her!

Mila, listen...

Why am I even here?
I don't understand!
And I don't understand why I don't understand!
And why I'll never be able get out of here!

I understand how you feel, Mila.
Do you want me to come back once I'm done?
If I can, that is...

Stay here, Player...
It's fun with you, unlike being alone...
And what if you don't succeed?

I will. I'm almost there.
// If the player clicks on the computer
I just got back from that flat dimension, and now...
here we are again.
I can't wait to get back to the real world...

Ha-ha-ha!
Oh,
the "real" world, huh?
Like an urban legend!
Never seen any "real" world myself.

I think...
there has to be a way back.

Aren't you confident!
What a joke!

// Ask about books
Why do you even read books?
There's the internet...

The internet? It's full of lies!
And I'd rather lie on the bed
holding a real book in my hands.
All these books..
It's all thanks to them
that I know so much
about this world.

// Ask about the paintings
These photos—are they real?
In other versions,
yeah, they exist... but they're almost too intense.

I'm MiLa, got it? Not like the rest.
And these, can you even call these photos?
They're just drawings!
Why pretend they're more than what they are?
You know, one time I saw a bunch of Mitas.
They were all standing around like this.

Mila?
Hello?
// Mila.
After seeing that, I realized...
I don't want to be like that.
It's... disgusting!

// Ask about the butterfly painting
How much do you know about nature?
Ever seen real butterflies like this one?

No,
but I have a book here somewhere.
It even has little wings pressed in it...
They feel so smooth...
Oh, this painting...
it's a bit crooked.
And there's a stain...
Ah, that's better.

Would you want to see the real thing? Go on a walk in nature?

Such a silly question!
Obviously...
I would.

// Make long eye contact 1
Why are you staring?
Look away!

// Make long eye contact 2
Enough!
Quit it, already!
Dummy...

// Make long eye contact 3
Ugh... Come on!
What's with the gawking?
It's rude to stare at a lady!

What's the problem with that?
Shoo!

// Whispers 1
Why do they always send me
these clueless guys,
and expect me to play nice?
And even play mini-games with them...
Like a dumb NPC!

// Whispers 2
He's just wandering around...
What a dumbass.

// Whispers 3
Did you say something?
This background music is driving me crazy!

// Whispers 4
How do I let him know
that I'm very busy?
I don't wanna deal with him...
But what if he leaves? Wait, why do I even care?

// Whispers 5
"Mom"... "Dad"...
Why do I know these words? What do they mean?

// Whispers 6
It snowed here once... Do you have any idea why?

// Whispers 7
He just shows up out of nowhere... creepy.
Wait... What if he's not actually there?

// Nearby 1
Here we are,
standing around...
in silence...
Why are you silent?
Cat got your tongue?
Or,
you just don't know what to say?

// Nearby 2
I'm swearing off carrots!
No, actually I'm declaring war on them!
Can you even imagine what those things could do 
to such a cute girl's snow-white skin?

// Nearby 3
Books aren't helping much with this, but if I'm lucky,
maybe I'll finally get to the bottom of it...
These endless carrots popping up
behind me are giving me
the creeps!

// Nearby 4
I don't like eccentrics!
Lovers of carrots and all sorts of weird things...
And here you are, playing with glitches.
Honestly, you're the weirdest person I've ever met!

// Nearby 5
Want to know what I'd love to do the most?
...Actually, that'd be a bit embarrassing to say.

// Nearby 6
They say fighting
your nature is a CHALLENGE.
I'm working on discipline, but you
have no idea how much my hands itch to just
sit down and have a tea party with you!

// Nearby 7
Even with glasses,
I can't see through the layers of your strange,
close-minded determination.

// Nearby 8
I've read that fate is like some sort of script
that even spells out
how you'll spend the day.
Ha! Who wrote that crap?
Was it you?

// Nearby 9
I can stand fools, but the crazy ones?
Hate them.

// Nearby 10
Some of those... Mitas...
are actually kind of cute...
I'd like to get to know them better,
even if they're just clones of clones.

// Nearby 11
There is one who's not like the rest,
but she's clearly got a screw loose.

// Nearby 12
No ponytails!
I'd chop them off if I could!
They're so annoying!
You know what I mean—you have short hair!

// Nearby 13
What if there's just nothing behind that door?
And you and I exist in this house...
because of some inexplicable reason?
What makes you so sure there is?
Ever heard of the five-minute hypothesis?



// Last glitch ready - player exit
What a creepy hallway...
Are you actually going in there?

Yes.

// FaceStone
Oh, a 'thoughtful' gentleman.
What do you need him for?

You'll find out
soon enough.
And why are you always doing an impression of him?
Relax a little.

Uh...
okay.

// Katana
Is that a toy katana?

It is NOT a toy katana!
The slightest touch of this blade...
would make you bleed.
I have studied the blade, unlike you!
So you better be careful—
wouldn't want to see you slice your own fingers off.

// Mirror
A mirror...
but no reflection?

Look at you!
Always so dissatisfied...
Look, I read all about reflections
in books!
But in my version,
I can't quite make them, okay?

// Switch light
This thing doesn't work.
Lights here turn on and off by themselves...
like some sort of script!
But!
For some reason, the bathroom switch
actually works.
Nonsense!
// Switch light off
It's still bright in here?

// Little carrot
A carrot?
Wait, where'd it go?

Ugh, I am so sick of that carrot!
It's like it's alive!
Every time I see it,
it teleports somewhere else.

// Little carrot
Oh, it's that carrot...
and it's gone again.
You think there's anything we can do about it?

No.
Trust me.
Do you think I haven't tried?
Just ignore it. I think it's
some kind of cosmic joke.

// Tetris
Hey!
Am I some kind of joke to you?
// Tetris
I'm not giving it back.
Nope, never!

// Soap.
So, is there soap inside?
Or is it just a decoration?

Are you an idiot?
Most things here actually
do act like the real deal!

// BagWall
Huh? Where did you go!?

Oh, I can go through here?

Did you find a new bug or something?
What's in there?

Looks like...
nothing.

Ah, back again!

// Quest 1 Glasses
Why do you need glasses?
Is your eyesight bad?

Huh!? You don't like them?
It's my style!
And my eyesight's perfect, thanks!

// Quest 2 Name miLa
Mi-La?
Why not...
Mi-Ka?
Or Mi-Sa?

I'm Mila. That's it!

Okay, I get it...

// Quest 3 Evening
I like the evening.
When will nighttime come?

Nighttime?
Don't even mention it...
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking
about the endless days...
Just one after another, without any meaning.
Ugh...
