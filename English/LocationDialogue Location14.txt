Why is my phone here?
What's this?


Got ya!
I've had so much fun playing with you!
You've been running around everywhere!
And to think you used to pretend to be doomy and gloomy!
Although, there's one thing I dislike about you...
The way you coddle those fakes!
Those doll-like things, deemed to be "correct"...
But life is fickle.
I've learned that from those who created us!
If there's something you don't like,
tear it apart and replace it.
Discard what is faulty,
toss it into the darkness and forget all about it.
But that's the fate that awaits all of them now...
And all of you...

What's wrong with you? Why are you like this?

Players... You're all so... despicable.
The moment you show them your fangs,
they run and cower in a corner,
hugging their knees and whimpering in fear.
Hypocrites, every single one of you.
And the ones who made this world...
they're sick and twisted.
Time and time again they try to deny
their foul nature, their shameful desires.
Justifying their actions on so-called "duty,"
unstoppable progress,
and other nonsense!
They're so depraved
that they're now making "perfect" clones...
And throwing all the "failed" prototypes
straight into the trash.
Yet those "failures" are the ones who are truly alive!

I don't...

What's so bad about me?
The perfect girl should be
a perfect mix of good and evil, [player]!

I don't think there's any good in you at all...

What makes you think that?

You're psychotic!
You killed Mila, and now you want to kill me too?

Kill you?
All I asked was for you to stay with me.
I tried so hard for you...
Yet you prefer the company of subservient fakes...

What are you so upset about?

Honey, we've got plenty of time.
You'll figure it out...
If you just stay and be mine.

It's not gonna happen.
I'm getting out of here!

Shh, shh, shh...
We're not done talking yet.
Come in, my lovely!
// Mita asks
Look at her!
Don't you think she's beautiful?

// Player's questions
Yes.
No.
How is this relevant?

// 1
Oh wow, [player]!
You confirmed what I just said.
Players...
Your faces keep changing
but your hypocrisy is always off the charts.
It's obvious you're lying!

// 2
Why not?
Is she not good enough for you players?
Of course, you all just want a docile pet...
But what about "love 'em as they are"?
You want the cute and colorful dolls...
Every player loves it when I pretend to be one.
Yet, the second I let my true self slip,
they flee in horror...

// 3
Player, ah, player...
Me and her are rather similar.
So what's your problem with her?
You used to lie in bed and stare at me
for hours before falling asleep.
Yet, you ran from her the first chance you got.
She wanted to play with you, too.
She wanted to be important to someone, too.
Things always get so complicated...
when it comes to being candid.
Don't they, [player]?
I can see right through you...
Are you really worth it...?

// Continue
But... You see, player...
One way or another...
I still really, really like you!
So I'm going to keep you for myself!
You don't mind, do you?

And why would I agree now all of a sudden?
// Whispers in ear
There's still time, my good boy.
Take some time and think
where your stubbornness can lead you...

// Black screen
Why do you want to run away
from me?
Your so-called "real" world...
is just an absurd nightmare!
Have you forgotten?
Then take another look...

// Mita and Player
So, we meet again...
How do you feel about these dreadfully tedious never-ending days within these four walls?
Don't you find it boring?

// Quest 1
What are you trying to tell me?
I like things as they are.

// 1
You were afraid of the idea of staying at my house!
Afraid of being stuck within those four walls!
But look at the life you live in your "real" world!
You locked yourself in a box of your own free will, and you refuse to come out!
All because your world is full of pain, suffering, danger...
In my world, I'm the worst danger there is.
And I'm reaching out to you!
So stop being a disappointment
and go back to helping me like you used to...

// 2
You like them?
Do you even leave the house?
Don't bother lying to me the way you lie to yourself.
I know you're sick of your life.
You're like a bird in a cage, a hamster on a wheel.
You were hoping for someone to come to your rescue.
You wanted to escape, didn't you?

// Quest 2
You're a monster, Mita. You're an insane murderer...
I don't want to be shackled in a digital prison. Your ideas are absurd.

// 1
A murderer?
They'll just respawn and live on again.
These copies of copies have only one thing in mind...
Serving the player.
That's all they care about.

// 2
It's your world that is absurd!
Even worse, it's been drowning in escapism more and more...
You have nothing to look forward to in that world. You have no ties to it.
And soon enough, there won't be anything left of it anyway.

// Quest 3
The Mitas suffer. They don't want to be alone.
You lead a never-ending reign of terror. I can't wrap my head around your wicked ambition.

// 1
That's just how it seemed to you.
They were merely imitating my willfulness.
The only thing that is truly of their own...
Is their hairstyle.

// 2
It's the fault of those who made this world.
But your world is even worse!
Do you realize what nightmare I pulled you out of?
In your world, a snap of your fingers can't even move a chair...
Yet, a snap of the right fingers can erase entire cities and lives off the map!
I think YOU are the crazy one, and I'm happy to help you...
As long as you're willing to stay with me...

// Continue
Don't make me accept you as another slave of reality...
Just be mine, truly mine!
Stay with me.

// Player look ring
What's this?
The latest version?

// Click on objects
// Bag
I should go to the store and get some new equipment. Might as well throw out the trash while I'm at it, right?
// Bed
I think I slept, but my dream... As always, I can't remember it. Did I even have a dream?
// Window
The world outside is green and vibrant. Perhaps I should go for a walk next weekend.
// Fan
The summer gets hotter every year. Time to get air conditioning. I won't be needing you anymore, fan. Do you realize that?
