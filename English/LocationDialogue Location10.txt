Wait, wait...
Keep it quiet...
Going further is dangerous.
And, anyway...
how did you get here?

Um...
The ring opens the right doors.
I honestly don't know how it works.

The ring?

What's up with this place?
It's super dark.

I'll tell you later.
For now, head towards the exit.
You'll find an arcade machine. I'll be there.



Hurry up, don't be tardy!


// After mini-game
So? Got the point of the game?

That I'm made of flesh and bone, and you have dummies inside you?

Whoa!
Sounds creepy when you say it like that.
But that's how it is, I fear!

Right, but why do I need this information?

Think I was telling you that going further
was dangerous just for the lols?
You'll run into those dummies there...
The rejected ones. The "faulty" ones.
They're very aggressive! Do you really want to deal with them?

What other options do I have?
I'll simply go through a door
whenever I see one.

You're nuts!
Then don't turn your back on them.
And don't let them out of your sight!
They get shy when you stare at them,
so shy, in fact, that they freeze.
Don't forget that!







// Quest 1 (Why are there other Mitas down there?)
They just got their skins.
Now they need time
to gain a little more self-awareness.
Then I'll need to bring each of them
to their own homes.

// Quest 2 (Why is it so dark downstairs?)
We Mitas are "born" in the dark,
so we need to remain there for a while.
Just imagine
the pain of moving from darkness straight into the light...

// Quest 3 (What are you doing here?)
Still don't get it?
I'm helping the poor new Mitas settle in!
Who will help them if I don't?
You?

// Quest 4 (Why do we need this conveyor?)
Why are there so many Mitas being made?
Is there enough room for everyone?

Wait, don't tell me you don't
understand how this world works...
And that it's infinite?

Infinite?
Uhm...
What do you mean?
If 1.9 is the latest version,
there are only 19 worlds.

My gosh, you really don't get
how this world works at all.
Look, I'll use this blackboard
to explain it all to you.
Want to hear about it?

// Quest 5 (What is your version?)
I might be wrong, but...
Didn't I meet you in the latest version?
Or perhaps it was just my imagination.

Well, it's quite possible!
I'm from version 1.5.
Have you been there?

I have.
That's where I first arrived
when I was thrown into this world!

Whoa!
But how...?
I wonder which house index that was...
There is a "me" who just can't stop whining,
a "me" who loves horsing around,
a "me" with bad memory and who likes to prank others...
It's a long list...
Do you recall anything?

It was dark.
There was writing...
Something like...
"wanna play?"

Ah,
what a bummer...
It was that "me" after all.
The forgetful prankster.

// Mita wants to tell you [No]
Thanks but no thanks.
I'll do fine on my own.

Alright, suit yourself.

// Mita wants to tell you [Yes].
Sure, go ahead.
I just hope this won't be like high school
where I always fell asleep out of boredom.

You can leave right now if you want.
But if you're interested.
here's how it works.
A player downloads MiSide on their phone
and plays as much as they want.
This way, they create a new house
and a new Mita.
Here's a 2D representation.
These are the versions,
represented by vertical lines.
The houses are placed on these lines.
Let's say you download the version 1.14.
This means a new life is created on that version:
a new Mita and her house.

Heavens...

You can ask about the details
shown in this drawing.
I'll do my best to explain.

// He asks about the only circle
Why does this version only have a single circle?

Only one person played that version
and it isn't available anymore.
That's why there's only one circle.
The thing about versions like this
is that there are no other paths around them.
Sleepy Mita resides in this version, 1.1.

Sleepy?
Because she never gets to sleep
with everyone walking through her version?

No, that's not it.
I could easily pass by her door,
without even looking inside.

// He asks about the shaded circle
Why is this circle shaded?

Well, the whole reason this diagram is here        
is because of Pretty Mita.
She was the one who drew it.
We were arguing over
the fastest way to reach version 1.11.

So, who won?

ME, of course!
Look, this is where we are.
Version 1.15,
house index 809.
We need to reach version 1.11,
house index 805.
Her initial path was like this.
We tried to come up with a shorter one,
and Pretty Mita suggested this path.
And then I just showed her the simplest path.
It's obvious if you think about it!
Just look here.
You can get directly to the version you want from the start.
This house looks like it would block your path,
but it's actually not in the way...
By the way, your ring works based on the same principle.
Where are you heading?

The Core.

The Core?
Hmmm interesting...
If you've been sent on the shortest path,
you'll be going through version 1.11 too.
You'll definitely encounter Sleepy Mita after that.
I think the Mita who sent you
came up with the same path.
Or maybe she didn't realize and you'll have to visit some other version.
Or perhaps she's a genius
and came up with an even shorter path!

I think I get it.

// He asks about the inscription
What's this about?

That's for Cool Mita.
She'll be here in a few hours.
She should move these boxes already
and place a sofa over there!
My butt hurts, you know!

Uhh...
Maybe I could help?

No, that's Cool Mita's job.
She has the strength for it.

// He asks about the drawings
Is that a drawing,
or 
does it mean something?

Nah,
it's just a doodle.
