Stay here.
I think I dropped something. I'll be right back.
Then we'll go after another new world...

Okay.


Let's play!
I want my teddy!
I lost him...
Find HIM!


Hey...
what are you looking at?









// Quest 1 (Who are you?)
I'm Mita.
The bestest Mita.
The first Mita.
That's what Mita said, my Mita.

// Quest 2 (Why do you look like that?)
Look like what?
Look like what?
Look like what?
My Mita says I'm beautiful and original.
That's what I look like.

// Quest 3 (What was Mita doing here?)
She will take me away.
We will live in a new world.
My Mita invited me.
She will take me away. And we will play.

// Quest 4 (Why do you need a teddy bear?)
You're the teddy bear,
and you're lost,
just like my teddy bear.

// Quest 5 (Why is Mita angry?)
My...
Mita.
She wants to play.
I am the only one
she wants to take with her.
We're the real ones.
We're the only ones.
Mita and my Mita,
0.8A and 8Ì54*.

// Quest 6 (Do you believe Mita?)
My Mita...
My bestest friend.
My Mita.
My only friend.


It's you!
Hey.
Let's play!
I'll show you how.
