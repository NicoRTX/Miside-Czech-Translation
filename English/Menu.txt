Peaceful Mode
This mode is still in development! It's so expansive that the developers haven't managed to finish it yet. But don't worry—they've promised it will be included in a major update coming soon. And look at you, already ahead of the curve by unlocking access! Now all that's left is to wait...
So, what is Peaceful Mode? It's your chance to reconnect with Mita in a completely different way! She'll be overjoyed to spend more time with you, from morning to night, in a world brimming with fun and surprises. Expect heartfelt one-on-one conversations, cooking meals, playing games, and plenty of hilarious moments together.
