Mita?
Ah, awake already?
How did you get here?
You were right next to me just now.

No, I wasn't.
You froze in front of the mirror.
So I left.
What's up with the rooms?

I rearranged the place
to make you feel more at home.
I mean,
four rooms lined up?
You don't see that very often.

You didn't have to.
I was getting used to the layout.
Either way, I think you'll feel more comfortable like this.
// Mita card game
All right,
shall we begin?
To briefly explain,
this chip indicates the active stat.
Health, for example.
We each play a card,
and if your card has a higher
Health stat
than mine,
you win.
Pick up your cards.
Let's see...
Whoa!
I've got quite the hand!
I'll go first!









You're next!
Your move!
Uh-huh.
Your turn!

Highest health stat wins!
It's all about strength!
Just look at defense!


It's your win!
You won!
You got me.
Why you...

I win!
I am victorious!
The victory is mine!
Hah, got ya!

That's a tie.
Evenly matched!
It's a draw!
It's all the same...











// The card game is interrupted
What's that sound?
It's coming from the wardrobe.

Sound?
What sound?
I didn't hear anything.
What kind of sound was it?

Knocking, as if someone's in there.

But...
There's no one there...

I'd like to open it and check.
I'm a bit creeped out.

This again...
Why...







What's up with you!?
It's a wardrobe...
I've got my underwear in there...!

Are you hiding something from me?

Why won't you just believe me?
What am I doing wrong?
I just want...
for you to be with me.

I'd like that, but am I just supposed to ignore this?

Why are you so stuck on that wardrobe?!

I just want to know what on earth that sound is!

It's just...
This world
only has these four rooms.
Could you just settle for that?
Please... Just stay with me.


// Don't stay with Mita
I get it.
This again...
If you want to look inside,
then go ahead...
Find out for yourself!




What the...

That happens sometimes.
The room got stuck loading.
Just wait for a sec.

This is so weird.
Are we inside someone's phone?
One that has long loading times?

Nope.
It's just that
this world isn't perfect...
We're being loaded
by the world's core.

Core?

Clichéd, huh?



Anyway, we can
play a console game
or play a game of cards.
You choose.



// Mita play fight
Wanna fight?
You have to win
four times.
Bring it on.
Don't worry, I'll
go easy on you at first.


That's a good boy.
Now, hold on to your pants!

Whoa!
Alright, now
I'm gonna lock in.

Wow!
Let's see if you can
beat me now!

You are
simply
incredible! Your fingers are amazing!


Hey, what's up?
That's boring.

Well, that's it.
Fatality, in case you haven't noticed.

C'mon,
get your act together or stay a loser forever!

What's the matter with you?
I beat all the white liquid out of you.
You just need to give it your all:
that's my secret to success!


All right, then.
How about we play some cards?
In my bedroom.



// Door > [ERROR]
Huh, what is that?
Where's...

Uh-oh.
Sorry...
I downloaded something
from the Internet.
I wanted to spruce up
the outside a bit.
But it turned out
to be the wrong file format.
I'll fix it later.

Is that why we can't leave the house?
Yeah, that's exactly why.
// Mita shy
Hey...
What's the matter?
Do you want something?



// Wall Clock
This clock,
what time does it show?
The time in game?
Or is it synced with my phone?

Well, how should I put it...
Honestly,
it doesn't matter what time it is.
And whether it's
late here or not...
A strong girl like myself
never gets tired!
We can have an eternal spring,
or a never-ending afternoon!

Curious...
also a bit creepy.
To be stuck in the same moment, forever...



// Photos of Mita
Nice photos.
I'm guessing these are of you?

Yep.
I like them, too.

Who took them?
Is there anyone else in this world?

You could say that.
I'll introduce you eventually.
For now let it just be us.
You'll get to meet them later.




// Portal
Oh where did the portal go?
Or whatever you called it?

I used a
little magic
and moved it
somewhere else.
We don't need it anymore.
It'd just get in the way.


// Mirror in the bedroom
It's creepy, looking into a mirror
without seeing a reflection.

We can turn on reflections
if you really want to.
But, do we need them?

Of course we do.
Or... will turning them on have consequences?

Yes.
We'll stutter and move really really slowly.
Ever seen an old cartoon with a low frame rate?
It'll be like that for us, all the time.

Got it.
Then perhaps we should keep reflections off.

Hey, [player],
you sure like mirrors, don't you?
Afraid of seeing a smile on that face of yours?

Huh? Not really...
I'm just tired
from all the work.



// Blue sneakers
Are these yours?

Nope, they're yours.
Don't you remember?

I don't have sneakers like that.

You do now.
You can wear them
when we head outside.

What about clothes?
All I have in this world
are the clothes I'm wearing.
Any way for me to get new ones?

Of course there is.
Though, I've seen what you wear—
and honestly, your taste isn't great.
But sure, fine, I'll help you get some.
Just not right now.
It's a promise.

Sure.


// Games on TV
What do you wanna play?
// Game milk
This is a fighting game!
Let's see who sours first!
What a game!
We've had enough milk for now, let's play something else.
// Game penguins
In this game, you get to play as a penguin
and just slide around.
We already played that.

// Stay with Mita
Huh, what?
Really? I thought you would...
I'm so happy!
And also a little confused...
In that case...
Please, stay with me—
forever.












// A game about penguins
It's super simple:
just collect the snowballs.
The one who collects more, wins!
Let's play two rounds!
// The first map
Wow! Why do you need so many?
Tee-hee! I've got the most snowballs!
Better catch up!
Ha, it's a tie!
// The second map
You're a natural penguin!
We should put you on real ice!
Pfft, you're so slow.
Still bothered by the first round?
Wow, we're tied! Now that's something you don't see very often!
// The game is over
Right, wanna play something else?
Or are we done?

// Tetris - Mita
What do you need that for?
Are you that addicted to games?
