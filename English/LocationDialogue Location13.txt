The ring!

// Answer 1 (Where have you been all this time?)
I've been searching for a way to get you to the Core.
All in one piece, that is.
That was the plan all along, right?
On top of that, I had to avoid running into
Crazy Mita, you know?
I also had to dig up any info I could
about this goddamn universe's backend, you realize?

I guess...?
But, why did you make the ring
instantly send me into a buggy, looping version
rife with danger?
Which I only managed to escape from
by jumping out the window into the void.

Sorry, I forgot to specify
what you needed to do there...
But yeah, it was the plan for you
to take the leap all along...
And well, you did it!
Good job!
Right, shall we continue with the plan now?

// Answer 2 (How did you get here?)
You must've been through a lot,
since you seem to have forgotten what we talked about.
I'm Mita, so I can move between different versions
without an issue, remember?

Not all Mitas can do that.
They're really suffering...
I saw it myself!

Stop it. Their versions are broken,
their worlds are bugged. I've talked about this before.
Damn it all...
You know who's behind all this...
Crazy Mita.

Yeah, it's her fault for sure...

// Answer 3 (Who was this Mita just now?)
That was Ugly Mita.
Aggressive and stupid.
You can't reason with her,
her entire world revolves around Crazy Mita.

Yeah, I've noticed.

Come on, we need to deal with the Core.

// Answer 4 (How does the ring work?)
Was it because of the ring,
that I was forced to take such a long path to the Core?

Yes.
If only we could've built the portal...
We could've just teleported
you right here.

Can you tell me ONE good thing about this ring?

Of course!
It's easy to wear.
And, it keeps a log of the versions
you've visited before,
and can open a door back into them again.

// Answer 5 (Why does Mad Mita need me?)
Why won't Crazy Mita leave me alone?
She's putting me in all kinds of danger,
but I'm still alive somehow...

My guess
is that she's looking for a suitable player...
One who'll accept her for who she is.
After all, Mita is Mita!
Although, the chances of a player choosing to stay are slim to none,
which is why she turns them into cartridges.
That way, no one can ever run away...
At least that's my guess.
Anyway, let's focus on what's important.

// Answer 6 (Is this the core?)
Is this it?
The Core?

Indeed. The Core.
As I've tried to explain before,
you players aren't a part of this world...
Meaning, you don't need special permissions to enter.
Or, well, that's what I think, at least.
However, I'm absolutely sure
that the solution to all of our problems
can be found inside this chamber!
[player], try and enter it.
I knew it, it let you through...

// Look on CoreMita
Careful, [player].
It's watching you.

Who is that?

I'm not so sure myself...

Great...


How's it going?
Hey!

I think I found it!

Amazing! That's great!

But I need to specify a version.

Right, I've found out that her version is...
00.98

Bingo!
Okay, and what's the index?

Uhm, index?

It requires an index.
Let me guess... you don't know?


Hmm, that makes sense, though...
Every Mita is given a unique index,
so you don't have to restart an entire version...
This is ridiculous!
How did I not think of that...





// Answer 1 (What's wrong with you?)
Nothing's wrong.
We can just pretend our issues don't exist!
Everything's great, but we've accomplished nothing...
I need to think...
We've hit a wall...

// Answer 2 (Maybe there's a way to get to know him?)
I...
I think... This is crazy!
It's madness, hah!
It's like looking for a needle in a...

What are you thinking of?

Some glitches overflow with information,
you know, like the world having its guts exposed!
Logs, logs, logs, data?
Could there actually be something there?

Huh? What are you on about?

There's a place I need to check!
Wait here.

Where are you going?

// Answer 3 (What if we attack Mad Mita?)
As you said...
All Mitas reset to factory settings on death.
What if we...

...just killed Crazy Mita?
Are you serious?
How exactly will you overcome a chainsaw-wielding madwoman?
And don't forget, her knife isn't just for carrot slicing!
Also, for some reason, she's frighteningly strong!
It's a miracle we're still alive...
Come on, we've got to think of something else.


// core console entry
I need to enter the correct pattern...
But how am I supposed to figure it out?
Mita, do you know anything about it?

Maybe there's a clue somewhere?
Can you try looking around?

// core console - nope programm
That's probably not it.
That's not right either.
Nope, wrong.
That's not what I need.
I need to find the character restart option.
// core console - nope version
That's the wrong version.
Oops, my mistake.
That's not it.
Gonna need to fix that.
// core console - nope index
Something's wrong.
The index is wrong.
I need to double-check the index.
It doesn't work.

// Answer 4 (Little people - Chibi)
You know...
I ran into a bunch of miniature people on the way...
What are they?

The chibis?
Uhm, how to explain...?
It's a phenomenon here...
Every Mita has a chibi projection.
Although, players can have them too...
Did you know that we Mitas can summon them?

Huh, how?

Watch this!

Just like magic...

But there's something wrong with my chibis,
most are just born dead.
There's this one, though...
Or well,
she just keeps running in circles.
