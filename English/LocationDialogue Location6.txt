Mita?

How on earth did you get here?

You're Mita, right?
There's something off about you...

Something off, huh...
You're right, though.
I'm not the Mita you met earlier.
Watch out for her. She's got something...
very sinister planned for you.

Huh, something sinister?

We don't have much time.
If this works out, I'll explain everything.
Look for the key. It's next to the sofa.

But...

Save your questions for later!
Give me the key.
Here, take this ring.
Huh?
You want to get out of here, don't you?
Uhm, yeah...
Put it on, then.
It's a useful artifact,
and you'll likely need it soon.

All right...
By the way, I'm
[player].

That's a nice name,
[player].
And I'm... Mita.








// MitaKind quest 1
Look behind you.
Could you open that console?

Is this a recording?
And who's that with her?

It's not a recording.
This is yet another player.
She's using him this very moment.
Listen, you should know...
She might turn you into a cartridge as well.

I need to hurry up and get out of here.
And so do you.

Definitely.

So, you're saying
she's using him.
What happens if I pull the cartridge out?

That may very well cause
irreversible damage to the cartridge.
Which means...
the player will die.

...
What if I just turn off the console?

That could work...
It's worth trying. There's a red power button!
Do you see it?
Found it.
Press it.

// MitaKind quest 2
I need to stay here a little longer.
There are some questions I need to ask her
to try and find out more about her.
Though, it's unlikely she'll play ball...

// MitaKind quest 3
To tell you the truth, this is my version.
I was here with another player,
when suddenly, something changed.
She showed up...
She turned the player into a cartridge,
and locked me down here.

Wait, she turned him into a cartridge?
She can do that?
But why?
What does she need the players for?

She's obviously gone crazy...
This is how she's having fun! She's toying with us!
Players turning into cartridges...
Some don't even realize it's happening to them...
And some that do, don't even fight back, damn it...
That sounds awful...
Listen, you have to help us!
Me? But how?
I need you, Player!
If you help us, I'll help you!
This might be our only chance.
The ring will lead you to the right version.
I'll meet you there.

// MitaKind quest 4
I still can't quite process
what happened up there...
That Mita...
Does she want me dead?

Dead?
I'm afraid she has a worse fate in mind for you...
That's why you need to hurry.

// Hide!
Damn it! Hide!
What's wrong?
Hurry, she's coming downstairs!
Trust the ringâ€”it'll lead you to safety!


Well, gonna tell me where he is?

Why would I?
You aren't going to kill him, are you?

So, you refuse to tell.
It's fine. I like hide and seek.
I know he's down here.

...Why are you so cruel?
You won't even explain anything!
And, also...
What do you think you're doing to the players?
They're no toys!
What's wrong with you?

Enough! Shut your mouth, doll!
