Hello, [player]!
We finally meet!
I'm so excited!
I know you have questions...
Well, as you can see,
I've made this special device
to bring you here to my side.
But you ended up in another version of the game...
In which I...
But that's a long story!
Anyway, I'm just happy to see you!

// Answer 1 - Mita
I am.
And you must be [player], right?

// Answer 2 - Mita
You want to go back already?
I guess you could... But what about me?
Let's stay together for a while.

// Answer 3 - Mita
Let me explain...
And here you are!
Got it?
Uhm... not really.
Well, it doesn't matter.
What matters now is that we're together.


Are you hungry?
How about we cook something up?
Here,
help me with these carrots.

Where did the vegetables come from?
They weren't here just now.

[player], we're in a game.
Come on, give me a hand.

Thanks!
Can you go grab the scissors?
They're in the bathroom.

Now, have a seat.


// Kitchen
Want some sauce?

No thanks.

That's a shame.
Sauce really enhances the flavor!


Thank you.

Finished it all already?
Huh, my portion feels
endless...


// Help
What's wrong?
Tell me what you're feeling.

My heart's racing,
and my vision's blurry.

Right.
I know what's wrong.
Can you stand up?



What are these?

Pills.
They'll make you feel better right away.
Stand in front of the mirror.

Take the pills.
Come on now.



So, how are you feeling?
Any better?

Yes.
They really worked that fast?

[player], we're in a game.
Things are much simpler here.
Even the smallest of efforts
can bring the greatest results.
It's all part of the game concept:
Simplification.

An example, please?

Well, take carrots.
You cut one,
but it's as if you cut three.

Look, this is all very sudden.
And I'm scared, more than a little.


What's the matter?

I found cartridges in the air vent.
They had names on them.
What's the deal with that?

Cartridges?
What cartridges?
Let's figure that out together.
But a bit later, okay?
Right now, we've got to eat.
Pass me the scissors, please.

// Ring
A ring?
// Mirror
How come there's no reflection?

Oh, right!
I forgot to turn them on.
There we go.
The reflections are back!
By the way,
I honestly didn't know what they were before.
They didn't exist in my world—
not until some update, that is.
Are there lots of reflections
in your world?

Well, yeah.


Do you recall
the three objects you found?
The ones you placed on the scanner?
Well, you see...
Those objects
are tied to this version of the game.
That's why you’re here now.

// Movbile TV
That's... 
the portable TV I bought you.

Yep!

You
told me it was broken.

Well, I wanted to
surprise you!
I told you a little white lie
to get you here, into my world.
See, it works—it displays information!
Oh, and by the way...
I'm something of an engineer myself!

// School cloth
Is this
a school uniform?
Why would you need that,
do you actually go to school?

Go to school?
Not at all.
But I love the uniform.
And don't you think
I would look cute in it?

// PC
Does the computer work?
Or is it just for decoration?

Of course it works.
Everything here
works exactly like in your world.

Back in my world,
I sat at my computer a lot...
And worked hard.

I know.
And it's because of your job
that you've paid
so little attention to me.

Gotta make a living somehow.
Though... how did you know?

Your phone's camera... it's on sometimes.
I'm sorry.
I've been watching you in secret.

You know, that's not entirely proper...
But eh whatever.

// Umbrella
I've played for a while,
but I've never seen it rain here.
Why have an umbrella?

It rains—but very rarely.
You just haven't seen it yet.
It might rain one day,
and when it does, you'll need an umbrella.
You'll see.

// Electrical panel
Why is there an electrical panel here?
And if we're in a game,
what's it for?

First of all,
we're in a game.
So asking 'Why' is...
pointless.
However, it does
reset the electricity.
Everything you see here
was made based on your world.

// Exit door
Can we go outside?

Well...
Not yet.
Perhaps later.
Let's stay here for now.
Here at home.

// Books
You've got a ton of books here.
Do you read them?

Yes, I've read every single one.
Being here alone
is really, reeaaallly boring.

// TV in room kitchen
Why get a second TV,
and an old one at that?

You don't like it?
I can take it away...
But to answer...
It's for decoration,
to lighten up the kitchen.
But it works, too!
I can watch all the
classic cartoons!

// Smartphone
That's my phone.
And it's no longer in my pocket.
How on earth did it end up here?

Uhm, that's not important.
Hey, I've got an idea!
Let's take a selfie!
Look!
That's a great picture!
A keepsake for you.

Eh I've got a question.
If I
run the game on it,
will I see you there?

No, there won't be anyone there.



// TV
How many
channels do you have?

It's not analog, you know?
It's connected to the Internet.
So you can watch anything
that you can find on the web.
Hold on.
Err, oops.
What's that?
A circle of kittens?
Oh, look.
You know what?
A-a-and now!
Want some juice?

Such strange ads...
Did the juice die?

Yeah, and this is
the juice's juices.


Ah, the taste...
I like it,
and yet, I can't tell what it tastes like.
Confusing.

Yeah...

// Mita shy
What are you doing?
Stop it!
You're embarrassing me.

// The statuette
That's one creepy figurine.
Do you
like such things?

Creepy?

Yeah.
Almost looks like it's cursed...

Well, it's definitely not cursed.
And not creepy either.
I find it rather cute!

Maybe you're right...

Mita?
What's happening?
// Mita kitchen
How about a chat
before we dig in?

// Start Eat
Bon appétit.

// Quest 1
It is, isn't it?
You can stay here.
I don't mind at all.
Actually, I'm
ALL FOR IT!

// Quest 2
You want to go back?
But why?
It's so warm here...
And cozy, too.
Plus, I'm here.

No, you're misunderstanding.
I'd love to stay.
I'm just... worried.
Worried I forgot something at home...
I arrived here out of the blue
and
didn't have time to prepare.

Oh... sorry. I didn't think that far.
// Quest 3
A dream? So you want to escape?
And forget this ever happened?

No.
This place just feels...
strange. Unnatural.
Although...
you seem real enough.

I seem real?
I'm VERY real,
you sillyhead!

// Quest 4
That's just how it is
in this world.
And you might find it strange,
but you won't be able to see things
far in the distance.

It didn't strike me as that odd.
Honestly, it looks classy.

Yeah, I think so too.
It's to avoid lag, you know.

Avoid lag?

Yep! There are still a few unsquashed bugs.
Let's just hope you don't run into any.

// Quest 5
Scissors or a knife, huh?
I could've used a knife to cut open the sauce packet.
But I wanted everything
to be ready
when you got back.
I love surprises!
Long preparations make it boring.
Tee-hee.

// Glasses
Do you wear glasses?

Not really.
But I can put them on, if you'd like me to.
Do they look good on me?
// Yes
There we go!
I'll keep them on.
// No
Well...
Whatever...

// Use the sauce
All right,
what kind of sauce is this?

It's a love sauce!
Chock-full of love!
And... a contrasting view of the world.
Sounds unusual, don't you think?

Indeed...

// Tetris - Mita
Is that your console?
Looks cool.
