Mila! No! ...You're insane!

Ha-ha! WHAT'S THIS?
Is that a new expression I see?
Go on, give me more!
I've had enough of just watching you!

// Mita arena "Hello"
How's it going, my restless little wanderer?
Still running around? Haven't had enough yet?

What have you done to Mila?

So you haven't, then!
Perfect! Let's play another game!

You...

Let's kick things off with a little examination!
We're going to check your coordination skills!
And we'll test your behavior!
What if there's something wrong with YOU!?
What if you don't even deserve that SKIN
that you're so proud to wear!?

// Show knifes
Take a look...
Which one catches your eye?
The right one?
Or, maybe...
The left one?

// Throw knifes
Are you serious?
How are they different?
I was just messing with you!
Playing with knives is old-fashioned, anyway.
Forget about it!
I've got something much better planned,
like...
// Show recorder
Check this out!
We need some music!
What do you think of this tune?
It gets me excited!
I'll start
with the rules!
// Show rules
While the music is playing,
you're allowed to move.
But when the music stops,
don't move!
Or you're dead!
The goal is simple: make it to the end.
If you can get there
we'll continue!
Why are you just standing around?
Run, sweetie, run!

// Ready recorder
Oh!
Look at you! So obedient!
A perfect little specimen.
I want you all for myself!
That was way too easy, though, wasn't it?

Let me out!

Don't get too comfortable!
We've got plenty more games to play!
Up next!
I'm going to close my eyes...
And when I open them,
I better not see you!
Got it?
If I spot you, you'll be punished!
Now then, let's begin!

This is pointless...

// Ready hide
You made it!
You're doing greatâ€”this is getting exciting!
But now it's going to get harder.
Much, MUCH harder.
Scurry! Hide! Run in circles!

Gah, damn you to hell!

// Player falls
That was a close one...
