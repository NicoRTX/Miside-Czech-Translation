// Player thinks + Make coffee
Seems like I can't do this alone.
I hope the Mita here doesn't bite...

What am I wasting my time on...




// Player tries to wake up MitaDreamer
Mita?
Mita, wake up.
Miiitaaa.

Mita, wake up!
I need your help.

Who are yooouuu?

Help me with the levers.

What levers?
Let me sleep...
Or, get me a coffee.

Come on, it's not that far...
Mita?
Miiitaaa!



// Player gives away the coffee
Hey, Mita.
Here's your coffee.



// MitaDreamer exercise
So... you said something
about levers, right?

Yes.

How come you know about them?
Though, why do I even ask...
Considering you're here,
you should know plenty already...

Hold on,
I need to sit down.

So?

I don't know what to tell you...
But I need to keep going.
The ring is showing me the way...

You have her ring?
No wonder
you found this place.

That's right.
So, can you help me?
With the levers?

Sure.
I will...
Help with them...


Mita, not again...
Let's go already.

Uh?
All right.
Let's go.


// MitaDreamer fall
Get up.
Are you that sleepy?

// MitaDreamer again sleep
Wake up.
We're almost there.


// Switches
Okay,
I'm ready.

I'm ready, too.

Then...
I'll start
counting.
And we'll pull the levers together.
Okaaaay?

Just don't fall asleep.
You can start.

// reversed counting in game
3
2
1

// Player lose 1
What are you doing?
Come on,
let's go again...

// Player lose 2
Again?
I can...
barely...
stay awake...

// Player lose 3
I'm falling asleep...



Perfect.
Thank you, Mita.

Mm-hmm.


The door...
is so...
slow...


I'm going back to sleep...

// this if player lead mita to kitchen
Why head to the kitchen?
If I fall asleep on the cold floor,
it's your fault.

// this if player lead mita to bathroom
I don't get it...
What levers were you trying to pull in here?

// player presses button after opened
Nothing happened?
Then what's this button doing here?

// player ask about coffee after mita stretches
How about some more coffee?
You're falling asleep again.

Whaaat?
Nooo...
This coffee tastes terrible...
I'm totally fine...

// ask about button again after pressed
Mita? The button doesn't work... Are you listening?
Hello?
