There you are!
Why did you leave the Core?
I told you to stay and wait for me!

You'd been gone forever, so I thought...

Well, all righty...
I think I found something...
It seems to be an index...
We need to hurry up and see if it works!
But first, let's get out of here.
Crazy Mita...
She should be preoccupied with a new player.
So hopefully she's too busy to notice us...

Mita?
Wait for me.


Were you looking for someone?
Here she is! Say hi!

Mita...

Catch!


Why...

Who are you?

You're... you're alive!
Don't you remember me?

Do I know you?

What the hell...
What am I supposed to do now?
There's no way for me to escape...

"Escape"? What do you mean?

Wait...
That's the ring...
And, what's this?

I don't know what this is.

It's the index!
So you found it after all!

I'm not sure what to say...

I need to get back to the Core.
You know...
Perhaps you ought to come with me...

Huh?
Sure, I'll come...

Wait here.

Mhm.
I'll sit right here.


Shit...
That was a close call.
So... we did it?
Let's see...
I'm still in that version.


Hi!
You're a player, aren't you?
What's your name?

I want to leave this place...

You want to leave already?
How did you get here in the first place?
Hmm...
Well, if you want...
Just take the front door.
Good luck!


A wall?
Hmm, that's all wrong.
Perhaps...
I know something that could help you.
I recently discovered
a door inside my wardrobe...
Turns out it leads to a basement.
It's clearly there to store all kinds of junk.
And also, there's a ton of fancy equipment.
I think it needs a code... or something.
I don't really get it.
And I don't really care.
Oh, it's kind of spooky down there too. Quite spooky, actually!
Would you take a look?

Uhm, okay.

// Player thinks
Looks like...
She doesn't remember anything.
Did we do it, then?
Did we restart her?
Now all I have to do
is get out of this damned game...


Just a moment.
I'd like to... hug you.
// ok fellow translator, this line is not used down below vvv
Huh?
// Hugs
It was nice meeting you.

Ahh...
it's a real shame
that you and I
got to spend so little time together.

Huh...?
What do you mean?

I mean,
you could've stayed with me...
It's all my fault...
That wardrobe and the... sounds...
I should have KILLED her sooner!

Hold on,
weren't you...?
How can you remember that?

HA!
Did you really think it would be that easy?
You're such a fool...
Just like all the other players...
And look, we're just in time!
The REAL
you isn't
needed anymore.
Sorry~

No way...
Did it not work?
No, I know we restarted you...

You still don't get it, huh?
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm such a great actress!
You should've seen your face, honey-bun!
This is so much fun!

Why are you like this?!
What's wrong with you?!

Yeah, I wonder...
What IS wrong with me?
I've got NO idea...
Why don't YOU tell me why I'm like this?
Why I can't ever become a Mita?
My version? I never had one
in the first place!
I'm just skinning these naive fools,
hiding beneath their faces...
There's no way you can restart me!
It's not possible!

You...
I can't believe this...
They're not the problem!
You're the one who shouldn't exist!

You too, huh...
It hurts to hear you say that...
Still!
It's time for you to go!
I'll see you again soon!
I think
everything is ready.
It's time to eject you from the console!
See you later!
You'll be my favorite cartridge...
Player with an interesting name.

// core console - nope programm
That's probably not it.
That's not right either.
Nope, wrong.
That's not what I need.
I need to find the character restart option.

// core console - nope version
That's the wrong version.
Oops, my mistake.
That's not it.
Gonna need to fix that.

// core console - nope index
Something's wrong.
The index is wrong.
I need to double-check the index.
It doesn't work.

// Why kitchen
Are you hungry?
I'm great at chopping carrots.

// Why bathroom
Oh, sorry...
You wanted to come in alone, right?

// Why bedroom back
Why are we just walking in circles?
Why did we come back here?
