You made it!

What is this place?

Show me the ring.
Mhmm...
There we go!
Time to clear some things up, don't you think?
// If the player did not approach the good Mitya and decided to play a race - Mita Kind
I've been waiting for you, you know!
And you just go straight for the racing game?!
Come over here already...
// If the player talked to Mita first, and went through the game to the end - Mita Kind
Congratulations!
I used to play that game a lot!
Tried to collect every coin and get first place,
for the achievement.
Damn, that one was difficult!
It took me a while to get used to the controls.

// Quest 1 (Should I trust you?)
At the very least, I'm not insane.
Unlike a certain somebody...
Also!
You won't find anyone as kind as me around here, sweetheart.
Surely you'd prefer to work together, right?
She's a cold-blooded murderer. We have to stop her.

// Quest 2 (How did I get here?)
The ring led you here.
It's a special invention.
You're a player, so you're going to need it.
It's the only way for you to access the version we need.

// Quest 3 (What is this place?)
These are the passageways
that connect the different versions.
They do look kind of empty...
Oh! I heard about this one Mita
whose world failed to archive...
And her house
simply ceased to exist...
Now she's supposedly hanging around
in these passageways.
Poor thing...

// Quest 4 (How did you end up here?)
Well...
it's been a while since we last met.
Thanks to you,
I got out of that damned cage,
and escaped from that lunatic.
And also,
I don't need anything special to travel between versions.
Unlike you, my dear.

// Quest 5 (What did you do with the ring?)
I changed the ring's path.
It was leading the wrong way.
Now, I've set us on the shortest path
to where we need to go.
It works like this: when you open a door,
the ring opens the boundary between versions.
That's about it.

// Quest 6 (Are the passages dangerous?)
Ever since I arrived here...
Inside this game...
I've seen all sorts of strange things...
But, somehow,
these quiet passageways...
Feel even less safe...

You're right, and this place is getting
more and more unpredictable by the day.
But cheer up!
We've thought of everything,
and we'll take the shortest
and most well-trodden path!

I certainly hope so...
Wait, what's in these passageways anyway?

Well...
Glitches, bugs, anomalies...
Living ones, sometimes...
Almost forgot! Very aggressive ones, too...

Umm...
And, hostile Mitas.
More deranged Mitas?

I know of at least one...
Ugly Mita.
And just so you know, it wasn't me who named her!
Damn her, though...
She's a very early version of Mita.
The main issue with her
is that she causes world-breaking glitches...
I'm afraid that we'll have to deal with her.
She's the closest to version zero, after all...

// Quest 7 (Will you help me get out?)
I'm not sure how to get out...
But, one way or another...
You did end up in the game somehow, that's a fact.
And, here's an even bigger fact:
You have no other option
but to rely on me, Kind Mita!
You're not wrong...

// Quest 8 (You were talking about some kind of plan...)
We need to reach the Core.
My intuition tells me that's where we'll find
the solution to all our problems.

But why not just go there yourself?

For some reason, we Mitas cannot
enter the Core Room.
I've only seen it from the outside.
But, players aren't Mitas.
I think that you, player,
may be able to go inside.
Shall we discuss the plan now?
Sure.
Great.
Right...
It's high time I introduce you
to a very energetic friend of mine.
Seeing as she's got a cool cap,
I just call her...
Cappie!
I've been going over the plan with her.
We're going to stop Crazy Mita together.
Please come in, [player].


Salutations!
You're my... new player?
What's your name?
I'm...

Hold on!
Do you...
remember me?

Huh?
Who the hell are you?

Damn it all!
We have a problem, [player]...
It seems SHE came here...
Crazy Mita...
Listen, Cappie!
Try to remember, for all our sakes!

Remember what?
Tell me, why do you look just like me?

Ah, we've totally hit a wall here...
Listen, [player].
This throws our plan
completely off the rails!
This portal was meant to be part of our plan.
It was going to make our journey a hundred times easier!
But we can't get it to work without Cappie's help.
And some parts seem to be missing, too...
She may be fussy, but her mind works quickly...
What do we do now?
I'll... I'll think of something...
So what did Crazy Mita do to Cappie?

I... I've seen this before.
She killed her.
Killed her?!

And, as you might have guessed...
After dying, Mitas simply reboot.
Cappie got reset to factory settings
and forgot everything important.
In other words...
we're completely screwed.

That sounds horrible...
Better than disappearing forever, I guess...
Or maybe not...
What about players?
Will killing us wipe our memories, too?

It is possible to wipe your memories,
but only if you've been turned into a cartridge.
As for a living player getting killed...
I don't know what would happen.

Cartridges again, huh...
So how can I tell if I'm a cartridge or not?

Come here,
I'll check you over.
// MitaKind check
Phew, it's fine!
You're not a cartridge.
You're a living, breathing player!

That's good news...

So, we've hit a wall...
Let me think...
We need a new plan right away...
Hmm...
What if we...
Yeah! I think I've got an idea!
Give me the ring!

Good.
I need to change the path again.

Did you figure something out?

Here's the plan, darling.
You'll have to make your way through other versions
to reach the Core.
Full steam ahead! You hear me?

And I'm supposed to go all by myself?
With no idea where to go, and no idea what to do?

I'll help you as much as I can.
As much as the situation allows, at least.
I'll set the ring's path, and...
think about what to do next.
We'll talk after that...
In the meantime, you can play with Cappie.
Give me ten minutes or so...

// MitaKind ready, if player near
All right.
I'm done.
// MitaKind ready
[player],
come over here.
// MitaKind ring
Here.
It's unfortunate, [player],
but you'll have to go alone for now.
I need to get the full picture of our situation.
Our plan was supposed to be perfect...
But right now, we're worse off than ever.
I need to look at things and figure out
what happened to everything we prepared...
I'll try to work something out.
Perhaps we can still get the portal working.
But time's of the essence.
Crazy Mita knows about this place,
so you staying here means risking everything.
Good luck, [player]! See you soon!

Right...
I just hope I'll live long enough to meet you again...










// Chibi players
But... why?
Who am I?
I want to go home!
How?
Why?

What the...?

// LimpingPerson
You're a...
a real person?

Hi!
You new here?
New?
You're from the real world, right?

Yeah...
What happened to you?

Don't mind the limp.
I've been here for about a year,
and I'm doing just fine.
Hmm... So what is this place?
It's some sort of space between versions.
Do you know how to get out of here?

Can't say that I do.
I've never wanted to leave.
I have to be here...
Why?
Doesn't matter. I'm in a hurry.
My beloved Mita is waiting for me.
I have to find her...
Goodbye.
Wait...!
Get lost!


I heard everything!
I don't know what's going on,
but it all sounds so interesting!
I believe
you already know who I am, don't you?
I'm Mita!
But obviously not the same as that other one!
You know what I mean, don't you?
Cuz I've got this
HERE
cool CAP!
And BOOOM!
Amazing gloves!
But that's not all!
A kick-ass cute electric guitar, too!
I love it sooooooooooo much!
Want me to play a tune?

// MitaCap Guitar Yes
Hah!
Come here, my baby...
All right!
Maybe I could have played something more cheerful...
Oh, well!
// MitaCap Guitar No
Aw, all right.


Hey,
you ARE quite the energetic one.

I AM!
I certainly AM!
Now then...
Let's go
have some fun!

// GAME HUMMER

What a nice big button.
I really want to press it.
Can I?

You can.
If you're fast enough, that is!
But first, take a seat!
// Player sit
Right.
So, what now?
Can I press the button?

Hahaha!
I absolutely love this game!
We just need one more thing...
It's somewhere in my inventory!
Just a sec...
OOP!
Well...
You do know...
That this is an adult game, no?

What was that?

What, you don't know?
It's to lure beavers out of hiding...

Really now?
I haven't seen any beavers around here...

...Huh? Beavers?
Gah, let's just move on.
I want to start the game!

But...

Now then!
Do you know how to play?


// How play hammer game
See this number?
That's the timer!
When the time runs out,
it'll show you
if you should press the button or not.
If you're too early or too late, 
or press when the icon is red...
I'll smash your head with the hammer!

Wait, you're gonna hit me?

Don't worry,
you'll figure it out as we play!

// Kick player 1
Ow!
Why so hard?
Did it hurt?
No.
Then let's continue!

// Kick player 2
Okay,
I don't find it so bad anymore...
Don't you dare!
You better not start enjoying it!

// Kick player 3
I don't think this game is for me...
Ha-ha!
Oh yea! Cappie so stylish!
Cappie so great!
Cappie just won, IN YOUR FACE!

// Kick MitaCap 1
Oh, you!
Nahaha okay
I'm gonna kick your ass!

// Kick MitaCap 2
Not again!
Does it hurt?
Of course it doesn't! It's an inflatable toy!
And, you did win.

// Kick MitaCap 3
I'm starting to like this game.
And I...
I like it too!
And now you're my arch-nemesis!

// GameHammer End
Is that it?
Yep, that's it!
Let's go!







// GAME DANCE
Is that the dance floor?
It's so tiny...


Whoo-hoo!
Shall we dance?
First,
choose a track!

Let's go with this one.

Okey-dokey!
Lemme go first!
I'll show you how it's done!

// MitaCap StopDance 1
Phew!
So,
think you can break my record?
Come on, go ahead, do it!

// MitaCap StopDance 2
Ah!
How's that?
Your turn!

// MitaCap StopDance 3
Dun, dun, dun, dun!
Okay,
hit the dance floor!

// MitaCap = Lose 1
Ha-ha!
Who's the boss?

// MitaCap = Lose 2
Pfft!
Only three buttons,
but you couldn't even handle that!

// MitaCap = Lose 3
Maybe sliding your butt
across those buttons
will get you a higher score. Ha-ha!

// MitaCap = Win 1
Hahaha awesome!
Honestly, I didn't think
you could do it!

// MitaCap = Win 2
Wow!
Those are some great moves!
Good job! Nice!

// MitaCap = Win 3
Bam!
You can feel the rhythm!
A natural dancer!

// MitaCap = Draw 1
You!
Me!
We the team!

// MitaCap = Draw 2
Fate's thread links us!
A perfect duet!

// MitaCap = Draw 3
Just
one mistake!
And you'd have made... one mistake!

// MitaCap Next? 1
So,
how about another round?

// MitaCap Next? 2
One song left.
Shall we finish off with it?

// MitaCap Endgame
Okey-dokey!
We've done enough dancing!

// Just talk
// Photo
These are some stunning photos.
You sure like to party, eh?

That's who I AM!
Yeah showed 'em how it's done in this shithole! Boom!

Um... showed who, exactly?

Who did I show...?
Who cares! I bet they went totally blind!

// CutBoard
Whoa,
There's, um... so many.
But why?

Take a guess!
They're for doing amazing things!
Like...
Cutting up carrots,
and like
cutting up carrots,
and like...

Ok, ok, I got it.

Right, but actually...
the chopping board went ka-cha-cha and totally bugged out! 
And now there are a bunch of them!

// Books
Bet you've read them all at this point.
Nothing else to do, right?

Euagh, I HATE reading!
I like doing things!

That's one way to look at it.
But knowledge helps...

Boom - moving, creating, touching, you get me?
Books are just paper, I like to be in the moment!
If you stay here with me,
we could do so, so much!
I'm sure we could...

// Fruits
Are these fruits even real?
They look amazing.
Do they ever go bad?

Oooh, yeah, the apples!
They don't have time to go bad,
cuz I eat them all!
And then they reappear...

// Photo and cat
What a cute kitty cat.

Doesn't she look tasty?

Wait, what?
You don't eat cats.

Hehehe you blockhead!
Nobody eats cats!
I was just hinting
that I've never actually seen one!
A real one, that is.
Only pics on the Internet.
They're cute, aren't they?

Yeah, they're real cute.
I like cats.

// Mita Kind with ring
Uh what's that?

It's the ring's interface,
and I'm changing the path.

Just by moving circles around?

Look. To you they're just circles.
To me, they're data.

Are you sure it won't take too long?

Hush! Don't disturb me,
and it'll go way faster.

So what you're saying is,
if I keep on interrupting you,
you'll stay here for longer?

Oh, Cappie...
If only you had your memories back...

I don't think we can stay...

But that would've been so wonderful!

There won't be any "staying".
We need to get to the Core!

Can I come with you?

The answer is simple.

I can't?

You can't.

// PlayerChibi
I'm late... super late!
I am eating too much...
Gah, work again?
When will tomorrow come?
Where's my computer?
They'll kick me out if I don't finish on time!
Have I saved everything?
Does nobody love me?
Where are we going?
Hey!
I'm running out of patience...
I need to do more work...
Everything's so big here.
Where's my phone?
Sigh...
What even happened yesterday?
There's just no end to today!
Hello?
Any beds around here?
What am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to finish on time...
What's the problem?
Are these walls real?
A 20-minute rest should be fine...
Sleeping is for losers!
Time to wash up and get to work!
I'm hungry!
This doesn't look good.

// Player is gone 1
Erm...

Ahahaha!

Yeah...
He walked out.
Just like that.

That's so odd!
And funny!

Come on now.
[player], what's wrong?

// Player is gone 2
Wait, what?

He left again?

Sure did!
...What are you even doing now...

[player], come back to us!

// Don't pay attention
You didn't so much as look at me!
Hmph boring..

// quest Cap 1
What was your plan, anyway?

Plan?
What plan?

Oh, right.
You've lost your memories.

You're really something, guys!
Acting like I'm supposed to remember something!
Are you trying to prank me?
Looking at your frowns, though...
I can't quite tell!

// quest Cap 2
How does it feel to
see an exact replica of yourself?
You know, the one with the ring.

You know, I was ready to hiss at her!
That's how surprised I was...
Like, holy moly! Look, it's a clone of me!
Though, I'm way more fun.
Which means, I'm better, heh.
I mean look at that frown

I'm right here, you know?
I can hear everything you're saying!

// quest Cap 3
Don't you get tired wearing that cap all the time?
And don't your hands get sweaty in those gloves?
Why not take them off?

Eh?
You're such a joker!
Or, should I take something else off?

I wasn't joking.
Ah, whatever.

// Carrot
Woah!
That's a ton of carrots!
What a funny bug!
Hahaha!

// DoorExit
Stop, stop!
You're better off not seeing what's in there...
Let it be a secret.

What's in there?

A secret is a secret,
and secrets are meant to be kept.

Sigh...
Why do you have to leave me hanging like that?

// Tetris
Wow!
What's that?
A console!?
Lemme have a go!

Woah.

What do you do in this one?

You just
collect coins and avoid frogs.

Gah, sounds beyond boring.
Seriously, you call that a game?

// Tetris again
Huh, where did you get that from?
I don't remember you picking it up.
Weird, don't you think?

// TV
Woah!
Way to go,
you found a bug!
The remote is supposed to toggle the video,
but, for some reason,
it toggles the whole TV on and off!
Crazy, huh?

// Player sit
I think I'll just wait here.

What are you doing?
Wakey-wakey!
Let's go have some fun!

// Goodbye 1
Head out through
the living room door.

Bye-bye!

// Goodbye 2
You should get going, [player]!
It'll be okay. Don't be scared!

If it was me,
I'd never ever send you all alone!
So stay with me!

Cappie!
No joking, OK?

Awh...

// Goodbye 3
What are you standing around for?
The clock is ticking!

Hi!
Ahh, I mean bye-bye!
