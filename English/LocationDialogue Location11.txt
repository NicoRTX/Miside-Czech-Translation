Hiya!
Oops!
Sorry,
almost killed you there.
Uhm...
The fridge, I mean... the fridge almost killed you.
I had nothing to do with it,
I swear!
Truly!

Uhh, sure! I totally believe you!

Seriously though,
this place is dangerous...
especially for you.

// After a while 1
You're anything but a coward, huh!
It's so entertaining to watch you...
The way you stumble around
these places...
Run, pumpkin, run!
I'll catch up either way!
Attaboy!
This is so much fun!

// After a while 2
I see you're heading toward the cable car.
That's the longest path
between versions.
I wonder how you'll deal
with those who live
in the fog.

// Panties
What are you doing!?
Come on...
Don't look!
Fool!
You sillyhead...


Oh, okay...


Break a leg!


Who's there?
I can sense you...
Listen to me,
you're a player,
aren't you?
Help me find...
find a...
remember...
I'm not sure...
What on earth is going on here?
// Cry 1
I wanted to forget everything once...
I broke every mirror,
ruined the pictures...
but now...
all I feel is regret.
How stupid that is...
Everybody makes mistakes, sure...
But what is one supposed to do
when the consequences are catastrophic?
I wish I could just turn back time...
// Cry 2
They say time heals all wounds...
But what is time?
I don't believe in anything anymore...
If time can heal,
or at least take me away,
away from this world...
Then, I beg you, please
speed up time.
So that it can kill me
once and for all.
// Cry 3
She can love...
I was able to love too.
But my love was different.
Her love is intense,
vexing...
burning...
relentless...
envious...
furious...
crazy...
// Cry 4
They used to call me emotional...
"You worry too much, Mita"...
"You'll get through this, Mita"...
"You're not alone, Mita"...
But what am I left with now...?
Sadness,
despair...
and fear.
// Cry 5
It's useless...
I can't remember...
It's so hard to remember...
And the endless echoes...
I can't cope with the fact
that I'm trapped here...
I've always been here,
but why?
I can't remember...
Will it ever end?
I don't know...

// Mita get picture
This is...
a drawing...
I'm starting to remember...
Thank you...
But my face...
I don't have a face.
It's all HER.
She tore off a piece of me...
Tossed it into the void...
She's strong...
and clever.
I have no right to stop you, player.
Look in the wardrobe...


Hey!
You're in my way!
Are you just going to stand there?
How about you move out of the way?
Let me through!
Just because you're big doesn't mean you're all-powerful!

// HEY! STOP!
Why are you following me?!
Piss off!




// Funicular - radio voice
Hold on now... A player?
What are you doing here?

Who's there?

Another player, I see.
I'm Mitaphone.
I'm sitting here controlling the cable cars.
Do you realize how damaged
the place you're heading towards really is?

No.
But it's the only path I have.

Right you are.
Press the button and get behind the cannon.

The cannon?

Uh-huh.
You thought you were just gonna waltz right through?
You're going through the Monster-slap mini-game,
so get ready to blast.

// Funicular go
Right, time to hit the road.
// Funicular win
Amazing!
You did it.
// Funicular stop
Hey, get out of here.
On the double!
// Funicular wait 2
Why are you still here?!
I told you to get out of here.
// Funicular wait 3
I don't get it...
Are you really just standing there?
// Funicular tetris
What? A handheld?
Dude...
// Funicular goodbye
Bye.
