// The first meeting
Who are you?
What happened to you?
Can you speak?


Wait...
Are you leaving?

Yes.
I need to get
to an earlier version...

An earlier version?
Why would you go
anywhere else?
You can just stay here...
And become
my second friend...

// Skipping all dialogs
I see...

// Standing by the window (Random)
The doors aren't the way out.
You're in a hurry...
Running in circles won't save you.
You want to leave that much?
Look outside...


// Quest 1 (Aren't you Mita?)
Player... you're a player, aren't you?
Would you play with me?
If I can find the strength,
I would really like to play...

// Quest 2 (What happened to you?)
I'm not sure... I don't know.
I don't think anything bad has happened...
But everything good seems to be slipping away...
At least I still have a friend.
All the other players are gone now...
Did I make them go away...?
I'm scared...

// Your second friend?
Friends...
They're all going away...
Only one remains...
I'm sad, player.
Will you be my new friend?

I'd love to,
but I have to keep going...

But why...? My heart aches...

// Quest 4 (Is this your house?) - MitaLittle
Home?
Player... You've changed...
Your arms are shorter, and your face isn't as angry...
Player, you've grown softer, kinder.

I...
don't know what you're talking about...

It's okay...
Nobody will hurt me anymore, right?

// Quest 5 (How do I leave this place?)
Are you really leaving me?
Is this just...
my fate?

I...

The doors won't help you.

// Hold player (Random)
Why are you leaving?
Stay here...
Let's play...
Hey, player...
