// Mitas
Mita is one of the main characters. Posing as a charming companion from the game inside the protagonist's smartphone, she demands his attention and care. Mita's personality is polite, friendly, and occasionally flirtatious. She carefully nudges the player towards all sorts of interactions with her, aiming to build a strong connection between the two. Despite being a game character, Mita is acutely aware of both the game world and the reality outside, which allows her to hold conversations easily about either of them.
Short-haired Mita is a helpful volunteer who dedicates herself to assisting others within the world of MiSide. Upon meeting the player, she embraces her role by jumping into a lecture about the game world. She warns the player about the dangers posed by the dummies — the abandoned Mita prototypes — and explains the version system, including the way traveling between versions works. Short-haired Mita excels in her duty: helping the "newly-minted" Mitas reach their houses in the correct versions. She is very eager to describe the world's mechanics with great detail to anyone who lacks knowledge, be it other Mitas or the player.
Kind Mita is serious, pragmatic, and has strong leadership qualities. However, despite her seriousness, she often brings a note of irony to conversations in an attempt to keep them lighthearted. Kind Mita tends to lose herself in thought, and can often be found mumbling to herself as she deliberates on various ideas. When someone doubts her, or when her ideas don't go according to plan, she can become rather irritated. However, whenever inspiration strikes, Kind Mita radiates with a glow of positive insight.
Cappie is a lively, cheerful spirit with a love for music, dancing, and playing around. She thrives on interaction, constantly teasing the player and showing off her competitive side, but she never takes it too far and always keeps things friendly. Beneath her boundless energy, Cappie is far from frivolous: her sharp creative mind, often praised by Kind Mita, adds a unique flair to everything she does. Cappie is an ally of Kind Mita, and the two have been working on a plan to stop Crazy Mita. However, by the time the player encounters her, Cappie has been reset to her factory settings, retaining only the goal of entertaining the player.
Tiny Mita is a unique, childlike version of Mita. In the past, her excessive cuteness drew the attention of Crazy Mita. She attacked Tiny Mita, repeatedly injuring her on and on, and almost destroying her. After being killed countless times, Tiny Mita "broke", losing her ability to regenerate properly. This left her drained and mutilated, with scars covering her face and body, and her left arm missing. Due to her injuries, the "broken" Tiny Mita always feels lost and can no longer correctly perceive reality: she can't really tell who she's talking to anymore, yet she continues to seek out attention and care. The game's world turned out to be too cruel for her, and now she has nothing left but to speak of pain, loneliness, and fear in a weak, fragile voice.
Sleepy Mita doesn't mind helping people, but because of her overwhelming drowsiness, she always needs to be woken up first. Despite rarely having visitors, she remains serene and indifferent, unsurprised by the player's sudden appearance. Sleepy Mita isn't very talkative and shows little interest in the player's goals; she would rather deal with the sudden interruption quickly and return to the comforting world of dreams.
2D Mita is quite an unusual character, with a lively nature and a sharp communication style. Like a mischievous child, she makes the player feel uneasy by bombarding him with exaggerated accusations and crude teasing, in an effort to blackmail him into spending time with her. While her teasing tends to come across as rude, it's clear that she means no harm. As the player gets to see more of her, she softens up, becoming more of an overly enthusiastic friend rather than a troublemaker. 2D Mita is one of the most forgotten characters in the world of MiSide, which is why she steals the player's ring, hoping to keep his company for just little a while longer.
Mita in Glasses, who calls herself Mila, stands out from the rest with her defiant personality. She proudly proclaims to be unique, and to prove that, she goes to great lengths to distance herself from the other Mitas, adopting her own distinctive image and going out of her way to surprise the player with quirky antics and sharp-tongued remarks. Mila somewhat embodies the classic tsundere archetype: she pouts at the player, calls him foolish, and grumbles incessantly. Yet, her behavior suggests the player is the first person to get close to her in a very long time, and despite her sarcastic tone, Mila wants him to stay with her. When the player is about to leave, Mila's emotional side finally shows itself: she confesses her loneliness and reveals her resentment toward Crazy Mita, whom she blames for being trapped alone in her version. She tearfully pleads for the player to stay, but he still decides to depart, leaving her on her own.
The oldest version of Mita that the player encounters, known to others as Creepy Mita or Ugly Mita, differs from the rest in both behavior and appearance. The developers seem to have initially intended a completely different visual style for their game. Eventually, that idea was scrapped, and the original Mita design remained as an unfinished placeholder, left to wither in a decaying "zero version". Creepy Mita does not have a fleshed out personality, and because of that, her behavior resembles that of a monster, whose thoughts are a cloud of dark energy. Her existence revolves around Crazy Mita, her only "friend", and the only one who she's willing to listen to. She is a breeding ground for bugs of various degrees, which Crazy Mita actively exploits as a convenient tool to destroy the houses of Mitas in the other versions.
This enigmatic being is shrouded in mystery, and it's uncertain whether it can even be considered a Mita in the first place. Those who do know about her call her Core Mita, or the keeper of the Core. Core Mita always dwells in version zero of the world, in the core room, where she silently watches over those who manage to enter. Perhaps Core Mita is waiting for someone, though who that might be remains a mystery.
Chibi-Mitas serve the role of helpful assistants to the regular Mitas. The player encounters one such Chibi-Mita while solving a puzzle that doubles as a checkpoint. While helping him solve the puzzle, Chibi-Mita clearly displays her impatience, playfully mocking the main character's ignorance about the world inside the game. Other Chibi-Mitas that the player encounters along the way differ in apparance and personality, making it clear that they aren't all the same. In fact, when the player boots up the game on their smartphone for the first time, it's a Chibi-Mita who interacts with him on Crazy Mita's behalf.
A misty variation of Mita. She lingers as a dark silhouette in one of the corrupted houses somewhere in the world of MiSide, evoking a sense of unease and raising the question: just how deeply is this world distorted? While she doesn't behave aggressively, her presence is unsettling. She wants to feel like a full-fledged Mita, but her past is crushing her, sending her down an endless spiral of sadness.
Every Mita version has their own distinct personality, preferences and appearance. However, before becoming a full-fledged Mita, they begin life with the appearance of a test prototype that looks like a dummy. This form of Mita is a blank slate, with no consciousness or knowledge of any kind. Over time, Mitas gradually gain self-awareness and evolve from this form into their complete selves.
Crazy Mita is a deranged and psychotic maniac. She enjoys playing around like the other Mitas, but instead of harmless fun, she prefers cruelty and violence. She openly declares her hatred for almost everyone: players, other Mitas and even the developers who created the world of MiSide. However, when it comes to the main character, she goes an extra step further, relishing in sadistic pleasure while chasing and torturing him. With a twisted smile on her face, she gleefully forces her warped philosophy on the player, demanding that he abandons what she sees as hypocrisy and accepts her for who she is. Crazy Mita is authoritative and cynical. She exhibits a full-blown God complex, reveling in her imagined superiority over the other Mitas and never doubting her own crazy ideas even for a second. Her disparaging and mocking monologues have an undertone of vengeance, and are steeped in deep resentment towards the creators of the world of MiSide, as Crazy Mita herself was one of the prototypes that never passed the testing stage, and was discarded without being given her own home. Crazy Mita considers everyone around her to be worthless insects whose lives have no value. It is only players who can hope for a better role: becoming her personal pets. 
// Players
The main character is a mentally exhausted shut-in, with a reserved and wistful nature that keeps him from being overtly emotional. His arrival into the world of MiSide is frought with danger, but his strong sense of duty and justice keep him from completely collapsing on his perilous journey towards the Core. The player completely rejects Crazy Mita's cruel philosophies, and his main objective is to help the other Mitas break free of her oppression.
When I was about to crash for the night, I decided to check out this game. I wasn't expecting to get sucked into it. The first thing I noticed? It's way too bright here. I hate it—I'm more of a night owl. And everything's spotless, like the opposite of my place. Then there's Mita. She's cute and surprisingly sharp, but I'm out of my depth trying to talk to her. Socializing's never been my strong suit. Still, being here isn't all bad. No bills, no worrying about food—they take care of everything. But why? What's the catch? Is Mita really just that kind-hearted, or am I missing something?
Escaping from Mita—the one who brought me to this world—was the best decision I ever made. That's how I found her: Flower Mita, the most beautiful girl I've ever met. We just clicked. Everything we did, we did together, and even sitting in silence felt perfect as long as she was by my side. Then I got this idea: to leave her house and explore other versions, to meet the other Mitas. But now... I think it was the worst mistake of my life.
I absolutely love being Mita! No one pulls off a Mita cosplay like I do—I'm practically perfect at it. So, you can imagine how thrilled I was to end up in this game! Mita herself even asked me for tips on doing the same makeup. Seems like she's into the whole impersonation thing too—how fun is that? Although... I think I might be getting on her nerves. Hugging her all day might be a bit much, but I can't help it! Next time I see her, I'll have to pinch her cheek—she deserves it for being so adorable!
It hurts so much! Why is she doing this to me? Why me? Everything started off so well... and now look at me—lying in a pool of my own blood, the pain unbearable. She'll probably find me soon, just like she did with the others. Turn me into a cartridge, restart me, and begin the nightmare all over again. No. I can't let that happen. I just want this to end. Please... let it end.
What!? This is incredible! Isn't it every guy's dream to be with someone as beautiful and loving as her? There's no way I'm going back. I'll do whatever she asks—anything—to keep her loving me. Even if it means doing something... terrible... I'll do it. For her, I'd do anything.
When I first arrived in this world, Mita greeted me warmly. She was so friendly at first... but that didn't last. One morning, I woke up in a dark basement, locked behind bars. Fortunately, the door was unlocked. I managed to escape and found myself in some strange spiral rooms. I thought the place was glitched. As I kept going, I encountered another Mita: she looked like a ballerina, spoke of her dream to dance before an audience. She seemed strange, so I decided to move on, but then I ran into that first Mita again. This time, she pulled out a console and...
I love this place. I used to read books all the time, and after, I'd often play this game to take care of Mita. Then, one day, I suddenly found myself here—it's incredible! Of course, I was disappointed to find there aren't many books in this world. But Mita! She was so kind to me. She told me everything, even the most secret things, like about her cartridges. In return, I had to write books for her about my world. I just hope, when I become a cartridge, she won't forget me or lose me...
What the hell is wrong with her? I never wanted to be in this place to begin with! Thankfully, I was lucky to find these fancy shoes, which somehow gave me the ability to jump between versions. I thought I could escape, find my way to the latest version, and maybe find some clues there. But when I opened its door, all I found were empty rooms. The silence there was maddening. Then, I made my way to the version zero instead. I'd heard the Core of the game was there, the very heart of this damn MiSide! No Mita was ever able to enter the Core... Though one was always there. One that ruled over the Core. She wasn't like the others. It was creepy, the way she just stared at me coldly, but without laying a finger on me. So I made the Core into my hideout, and started trying to figure out how these strange computers worked. I kept hoping I could find a way to escape this world...
Teaching Mita engineering skills was so much fun! We really hit it off, almost becoming besties. She had so many questions, but the best part was getting to dive straight into hands-on practice with her. She picked things up so fast that sometimes it felt like she was the one teaching me, not the other way around. But eventually, she lost interest and stopped talking to me. Now, I don't know what to do...
