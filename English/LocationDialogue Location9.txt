Hey, you!
Hi!
You want to get out?
Then help me find the key!
// Key Search
Shoot! No key here!
Nothing here!
Zero, zip, nada!
Found it!

// The usual conversation
Huh, I thought you'd be shorter!
Look how tall you are!
You're just like my sister!

Your... sister?

Yes, my sister.
Don't say you've never met her!

"Met her"? That's one way to put it.

Are you stupid?

Um...

Turns out you are...
Come on, just help me find the key already!

// Next work
Here.
Put the iron into the pipe!
Thank you!
Now, get me that firewood, I can't reach it!
Much appreciated!
Some more help over here, please!
All done! Now...
Look, this is so beautiful...
Come on, press it!
Tadaa!
Here we go, you can have it!
The key is yours!









// Quest 1 (Are you Mita?)
I'm ChibiMita.fbx!
Tons of lines,
simplest armature, and—
best of all—gorgeous hair!

// Quest 2 (Have we seen each other yet?)
Mister sillyhead!
You're kinda cute, you know,
asking silly questions like that.
Nope,
this is my first time meeting you!
But...
But, if someone DID steal my marvelous looks,
they should really feel ashamed!

// Quest 3 (Why are you here?)
Don't you get it?
This is a checkpoint!
"Show me your wits!"
"You can pass!"
I'm here to guide the hopelessly lost!

// Quest 4 (Why are you helping me?)
What makes you so special
that you DON'T deserve help?

What?

You're so silly...
Appearing out of nowhere like that!
You're not supposed to be here,
so, I'm helping you!

Bye-bye, sillyhead!
